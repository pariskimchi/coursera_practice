step 1. CREATE model

SQL 쿼리문으로 데이타 모델셋 만들기 

CREATE MODEL numbikes.model 
OPTIONS
    (model_type='linear_reg',
        labels=[`num_trips`]) AS
    WITH bike_data AS
    (
        SELECT COUNT(*) as num_trips,

    )

Step 2.  Prediction

SELECT 
    predicted_num_trips, num_trips, trip_date
FROM
    ml.PREDICT(MODEL 'numbikes.model',
        (WITH bike_data AS
        ( SELECT COUNT(*) as num_trips)
        )
    )
