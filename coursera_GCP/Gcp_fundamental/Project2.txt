Predicting Visitor Purchase with 
a Classification Model with BigQuery ML

Task 1. Explore ecommerce data 

시나리오:
    데이터 분석팀이 Google Analytics 로그를 추출하고 ,  
    raw data 테이블을 만들었다 


Question: out of the total visitors who visited our website, 
    what % made a purchase?

1. click the query EDITOR 
2. Add query 

    #standardSQL
-- WITH visitors AS(
-- SELECT
-- COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS total_visitors
-- FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
-- ),
-- purchasers AS(
-- SELECT
-- COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS total_purchasers
-- FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
-- WHERE totals.transactions IS NOT NULL
-- )
-- SELECT
--   total_visitors,
--   total_purchasers,
--   total_purchasers / total_visitors AS conversion_rate
-- FROM visitors, purchasers

3. click run 

Question: What are the top 5 selling products?

4. add query 

-- SELECT
--   p.v2ProductName,
--   p.v2ProductCategory,
--   SUM(p.productQuantity) AS units_sold,
--   ROUND(SUM(p.localProductRevenue/1000000),2) AS revenue
-- FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`,
-- UNNEST(hits) AS h,
-- UNNEST(h.product) AS p
-- GROUP BY 1, 2
-- ORDER BY revenue DESC
-- LIMIT 5;

Question: How many visitors bought on subsequent visits 
    to the website?

# visitors who bought on a return visit (could have bought on first as well
WITH all_visitor_stats AS (
SELECT
  fullvisitorid, # 741,721 unique visitors
  IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid
)
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT fullvisitorid) AS total_visitors,
  will_buy_on_return_visit
FROM all_visitor_stats
GROUP BY will_buy_on_return_visit


Task 2. Select features and create your training dataset

  =>특정 주요 컬럼을 선택해서 훈련 데이터셋 만들기 

  => 훈련데이터셋을 위한 복잡한 쿼리문을 만든다 


SELECT
  * EXCEPT(fullVisitorId)
FROM
  # features
  (SELECT
    fullVisitorId,
    IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
    IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site
  FROM
    `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  WHERE
    totals.newVisits = 1)
  JOIN
  (SELECT
    fullvisitorid,
    IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM
      `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid)
  USING (fullVisitorId)
ORDER BY time_on_site DESC
LIMIT 10;


Task 3. Create a Bigquery dataset to store model 

  => 빅쿼리 데이터 셋을 만든다 모델을 놓기 위해서 

  => 빉 쿼리 데이터셋을 ecommerce 데이터셋을 만들어준다

Task 4. Select a BigQuery ML model type and specify Options

  # MOdel = forecasting 
    model_type = linear_reg,
    label_data_type = numeric_value 
  
  # model = classification 
    model_type = logistic_reg, 
    label_data_type = 0 or 1 for binary classification


CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `ecommerce.classification_model`
OPTIONS
(
model_type='logistic_reg',
labels = ['will_buy_on_return_visit']
)
AS
#standardSQL
SELECT
  * EXCEPT(fullVisitorId)
FROM
  # features
  (SELECT
    fullVisitorId,
    IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
    IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site
  FROM
    `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  WHERE
    totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170430') # train on first 9 months
  JOIN
  (SELECT
    fullvisitorid,
    IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM
      `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid)
  USING (fullVisitorId)
;



Task 5. Evaluate classification model performance 

  => 모델평가를 위해서 
  => False Positive Rate 를 줄이기 위한게 주요 목적으로 할건지 
  => True Positive Rate를 높이는걸 목적으로 할건지 

  일단 상황별로 시나리오별로 모델평가를 한다 

  혹은 ROC 점수 비교로 가던가 
  
  빅쿼리에서는 주로 Roc_auc로 주로 모델 평가 한다 


SELECT
  roc_auc,
  CASE
    WHEN roc_auc > .9 THEN 'good'
    WHEN roc_auc > .8 THEN 'fair'
    WHEN roc_auc > .7 THEN 'not great'
  ELSE 'poor' END AS model_quality
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL ecommerce.classification_model,  (
SELECT
  * EXCEPT(fullVisitorId)
FROM
  # features
  (SELECT
    fullVisitorId,
    IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
    IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site
  FROM
    `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  WHERE
    totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20170501' AND '20170630') # eval on 2 months
  JOIN
  (SELECT
    fullvisitorid,
    IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM
      `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid)
  USING (fullVisitorId)
));


Task 6. Improve model performance with feature engineering

  모델 성능을 향상시키기 위해 뭐든 한다 feature_enginerring

    => 새로운 특징 추출을 위해서 
      classification_model_2 를 만든다 

CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `ecommerce.classification_model_2`
OPTIONS
  (model_type='logistic_reg', labels = ['will_buy_on_return_visit']) AS
WITH all_visitor_stats AS (
SELECT
  fullvisitorid,
  IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid
)
# add in new features
SELECT * EXCEPT(unique_session_id) FROM (
  SELECT
      CONCAT(fullvisitorid, CAST(visitId AS STRING)) AS unique_session_id,
      # labels
      will_buy_on_return_visit,
      MAX(CAST(h.eCommerceAction.action_type AS INT64)) AS latest_ecommerce_progress,
      # behavior on the site
      IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
      IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site,
      totals.pageviews,
      # where the visitor came from
      trafficSource.source,
      trafficSource.medium,
      channelGrouping,
      # mobile or desktop
      device.deviceCategory,
      # geographic
      IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country
  FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`,
     UNNEST(hits) AS h
    JOIN all_visitor_stats USING(fullvisitorid)
  WHERE 1=1
    # only predict for new visits
    AND totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170430' # train 9 months
  GROUP BY
  unique_session_id,
  will_buy_on_return_visit,
  bounces,
  time_on_site,
  totals.pageviews,
  trafficSource.source,
  trafficSource.medium,
  channelGrouping,
  device.deviceCategory,
  country
);

  2. 그리고 새로운 classification_model_2 모델 성능 평가 해본다 

  #standardSQL
SELECT
  roc_auc,
  CASE
    WHEN roc_auc > .9 THEN 'good'
    WHEN roc_auc > .8 THEN 'fair'
    WHEN roc_auc > .7 THEN 'not great'
  ELSE 'poor' END AS model_quality
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL ecommerce.classification_model_2,  (
WITH all_visitor_stats AS (
SELECT
  fullvisitorid,
  IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid
)
# add in new features
SELECT * EXCEPT(unique_session_id) FROM (
  SELECT
      CONCAT(fullvisitorid, CAST(visitId AS STRING)) AS unique_session_id,
      # labels
      will_buy_on_return_visit,
      MAX(CAST(h.eCommerceAction.action_type AS INT64)) AS latest_ecommerce_progress,
      # behavior on the site
      IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
      IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site,
      totals.pageviews,
      # where the visitor came from
      trafficSource.source,
      trafficSource.medium,
      channelGrouping,
      # mobile or desktop
      device.deviceCategory,
      # geographic
      IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country
  FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`,
     UNNEST(hits) AS h
    JOIN all_visitor_stats USING(fullvisitorid)
  WHERE 1=1
    # only predict for new visits
    AND totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20170501' AND '20170630' # eval 2 months
  GROUP BY
  unique_session_id,
  will_buy_on_return_visit,
  bounces,
  time_on_site,
  totals.pageviews,
  trafficSource.source,
  trafficSource.medium,
  channelGrouping,
  device.deviceCategory,
  country
)
));


Task 7. Predict which new visitor will comeback and purchase 


  => 새로운 방문자가 재방문 할건지 , 구매할건지 예측 

  SELECT
*
FROM
  ml.PREDICT(MODEL `ecommerce.classification_model_2`,
   (
WITH all_visitor_stats AS (
SELECT

     UNNEST(hits) AS h
    JOIN all_visitor_stats USING(fullvisitorid)
  WHERE
    # only predict for new visits
    totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20170701' AND '20170801' # test 1 month
  GROUP BY
  unique_session_id,
  will_buy_on_return_visit,
  bounces,
  time_on_site,
  totals.pageviews,
  trafficSource.source,
  trafficSource.medium,
  channelGrouping,
  device.deviceCategory,
  country
)
)
ORDER BY
  predicted_will_buy_on_return_visit DESC;
